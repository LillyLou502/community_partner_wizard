# community_partner_wizard
The community partner wizard is a database with community organization mission and contact information. The database allows users to create, read, update, and delete entries in a database. When using the read function, it also allows users to sort community partners by social issue topic. The program provides a total count of the number of community partners in the database.
## installation
* Run `git clone https://github.com/LillyLou502/community_partner_wizard.git`
* Run `cd community_partner_wizard`
* Run `python3 cp_database.py`
## features_list
For this project, the features I chose to include are: 
1) implement a master loop console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program 
2) create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data 
3) create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program 
4) create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used
5) analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
## special_instructions
While I had a larger and more complex vision for this project when I first began, I needed to simplify it as my skill set is still in the beginning level. For example, I did not use regular expressions in this database to verify correct entries for phone numbers and emails. Through the command function, users will be prompted with specific key words to use to continue in the program and these key words are case sensitive and must be typed exactly as they appear. Duplicate entries of community partners are currently allowed. I realize there are many features that would enhance this basic program, and I hope to be able to add them in the future as I continue learning Python.
